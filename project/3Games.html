                The pastoral nomadic culture that developed in the Eurasian steppes around the first millennium B.C.
                played a huge role in the development of Central Asian cultures, which also included Kazakhstan, and
                managed to last for several millennia. The role of cattle breeding is especially reflected in the
                cultural heritage of Kazakhs: in beliefs, traditions, customs, fairy tales, musical heritage, funeral
                rites, and even in games. The Kazakh culture distinguishes four main types of domesticated animals,
                among which the horse took a special place due to the nomadic way of life of the people. In addition to
                horseback riding skills, nomads also paid attention to physical training and strategic thinking. Human
                military skills also played a major role.

            National Games
        </h1>
        <div class="scnd-inf display-9 mt-5">
            Every nation has its own national games, and Kazakhstan is no exception. Kazakh national games are an
            integral part of Kazakh culture and combine echoes of work and spiritual activities. So, every game has a
            distinctive ethnocultural experience, which can be interesting to both children and adults. Some national
            games go back to deep history, were held in ancient times, and have survived to this day. This article gives
            examples of the most popular equestrian, intellectual, and children's games.
        </div>

        <h3 class="mt-5">Kokpar</h3>
        <div>
            <div class="scnd-inf display-9">“Kokpar” is one of the popular national games of Kazakhstan. It can also be called a
                peculiar horseracing “soccer” of nomads. This game was widespread in ancient times not only among
                Kazakhs
                but also among Altaians (kok-boru), Kyrgyz (ulak-tartysh), Bashkirs (kuk-bure), and many other peoples
                of
                Asia. The game used to be played when returning from hunting.

        <h3 class="mt-5">Togyz Kumalak</h3>
        <div>
            <div class="scnd-inf display-9">“Togyz kumalak” is a board game for quick calculations. It is usually played with a
                wooden playing board that has nine main notches for balls. Each of the notches has a different name.
                There are also two extra tiles called “kazan” where you put your opponent's recaptured marbles. Each
                player is given a total of 81 marbles. Four arithmetic operations are used for the game. You may notice
                that the number “9” is often found in the foundations of the game — it was a sacred number among the
                Mongols and many nomadic peoples. Shepherds used to play this game by creating holes in the ground.
                Therefore, it was also called “chabans algebra”, where the chaban was an analog of the shepherd.

        <h3 class="mt-5">Asyq</h3>
        <div>
            <div class="scnd-inf display-9">“Asyks” carries the title of a symbol of childhood. Almost everyone had at least one
                “asyk” as a child. “Asyk” is a knee bone in a joint of sheep, rams, or cattle. Asyks are used for games
                and divination throughout Central Asia, Buryatia, and Mongolia. The game of asyks has a counterpart even
                in Russia — the game of “babka”. The only difference is that the Russian counterpart mainly used only
                bones from cattle. First, the bones were boiled in saltwater. After that, the bones were dyed in
                different colors, which depended on the price of the bones. The cheapest (and the smallest) were not
                dyed. Among all asyks, there was the biggest, which was called “saka”. It was put on the line and served
                as a prize to be knocked out. There was also a special asyk, which was used to beat out other asyks. The
                asyks are played on an even ground, on which a line is drawn. Along this line, asks are placed at a
                certain distance, and the game begins. The main goal is to beat out other people's asyks using your own.

        <h3 class="mt-5">Competitions and Tournaments</h3>
        <div class="scnd-inf display-9">Many equestrian games have taken on the status of sports games. At the moment there are
            various sports competitions in different parts of Kazakhstan. Competitions for some games are held within
            Asia, such as the championships in “audaryspak”. Hippodromes or in the steppe are the main places where
            competitions are held. And for such games as “togyz kumalak” a sports federation was formed and
            masterclasses, lessons and competitions are held.
            <br><br>
            Kyrgyzstan also had a hand in hosting competitions in various national games, becoming the first country to
            host the World Nomad Games in 2014. The last Games were held in 2018, involving 37 sports. The Games include
            competitions in asyks (ordo), kokpar (kok bory) and togyz kumalak (toguz korgool), and many other ethnic
            sports and games. Turkey has taken over the hosting of the IV World Nomad Games in 2020.
            <br><br>
            Tournaments and competitions on national games in Kazakhstan are sometimes broadcast on domestic channels,
            but most national games can be seen in the villages, especially in spring, during the Nauryz holiday.
