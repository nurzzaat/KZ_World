                <span class="start">Traditional Kazakh food </span>
                is nomadic food. For centuries, Kazakhs were herders who raised horses, sheep,
                cows, and Bactrian camels. They relied on these animals for transportation, clothing, and food,
                developing cooking techniques and methods of preservation that facilitated their nomadic lifestyle.
                <br><br>
                Being able to produce food that was portable and long-lasting was important to the Kazakh way of life.
                Food needed to withstand many months on the road so salting and drying meat became a necessity. Milk was
                soured to improve its shelf life while boiling was the most practical and commonly used method of
                cooking.
                <br><br>
                The nomadic lifestyle made raising crops difficult so meat has always formed the biggest part of the
                Kazakh diet. Mutton and beef were considered everyday food while horse and camel were regarded as
                festival meats. Horse and mutton are the most popular proteins in Kazakh cuisine and figure prominently
                in many dishes, including Beshbarmak, the Kazakh national dish.

            Kazakh cuisine is a great reminder why food is one of the best communicators. It can tell you so much about
            the local culture and Kazakh food is the perfect example of that.

            Looking at dishes like kurt, beshbarmak, and kazy, you know this was a cuisine and culture heavily shaped by
            nomadism and a strong sense of community. Food was simple but it was made to last, it was meant to be
            shared, and nothing was left to waste. Even horse hair was saved and braided into rope.

            Dishes like kazy and zhaya may not be for everyone, but keep an open mind and the food in Kazakhstan will
            show you what life was like on the plains.
