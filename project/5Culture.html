                Kazakhstan culture reflects the history of the nomadic tribes which roamed the Kazakh steppe forming
                their unique worldview, creating eclectic customs and traditions, and mixing with neighboring cultures.
                Many Kazakhs adopted a more sedentary lifestyle in the 19th and 20th centuries, leading to the
                development of new cultural characteristics for Kazakhs, such as huge, glittering, modern cities. Today,
                Kazakhstan culture represents the peoples of large swaths of Central Asia, capturing this nomadic spirit
                in various types of arts and traditions.

            Traditions
        </h1>
        <h3>There are some other interesting traditions related to hospitality:</h3>
        <div class="scnd-inf">
            <li><b>Toqymqagar </b>or the farewell ceremony. Usually happens before the departure of someone from the
                family for a long time. A ram must be cut and a toy-dastarkhan must be arranged. Seer-offs say various
                wishes for those going on a long journey.
            </li>
            <li><b>Shashu </b>is a ritual during the holiday: the arrival of dear guests, weddings, matchmakings, etc.,
                the heroes of the occasion are showered with sweets and coins. Children usually collect scattered candy
                and money. Kazakhs believe that sweets picked up during Shashu bring good luck.
            </li>
            <li><b>Sarqyt </b>is a tradition to take away food after the dastarkhan. The hosts give the guests the rest
                of the meal to take with them.
            </li>
            <li><b>Toy-Dastarkhan </b>is a festive feast. In addition to a rich feast, the Toy-Dastarkhan includes
                sports, music, song contests (aitys), races, and other games.
            </li>
            <li><b>Suyunshi </b>is a custom to give valuable gifts to those who bring good news.
            </li>
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Aitys</h3>
        <div class="scnd-inf">
            <b>Aitys </b> is one of the obligatory parts of the holiday program of any Kazakh holiday. It is a
            poetic-musical competition of the Kazakh singers-improvisers.
            <br>
            During the aitys, the performers sit or stand in front of each other and start a kind of song dialogue,
            constantly passing the word to each other, continuing the theme started by the opponent. Aitys can be held
            on any arbitrary theme. According to the results of the competition, the winner is chosen. The jury
            consisting of distinguished people or guests of the festival evaluates not only the musicality and
            performing talent, but also the skill in parrying the arguments of the opponent, humor, and ingenuity.
            <br>
            Aitys is somewhat reminiscent of modern rap battles: the same principle is used in the order of performance
            and the evaluation of participants.
            <br>
            Several akyns can take part in aitys, although paired performances are more traditional. Aitys is often held
            between a man and a woman. For example, in 1946, Kazakh composer Mukan Tulebayev wrote the opera “Birzhan
            and Sarah” based on aitys between famous akyns of the XIX century Birzhan-sal and Sarah Tastanbekkyzy.

        <h3>Nauryz Holiday</h3>
        <div class="scnd-inf">
            Another wonderful tradition dating back to the ancient pre-Islamic times of the history of the Kazakh people
            — the holiday Nauryz. It is a holiday of spring, renewal of nature, the beginning of a new year, a new life.
            According to Tengrian beliefs, Nauryz is considered the beginning of the New Year and is celebrated on March
            22 on the day of the vernal equinox.
            <br>
            Like the rest of the great feasts, Nauryz consists of many small rituals and customs. The holiday begins at
            dawn when all the inhabitants of the village or aul come out together to plant trees under the guidance of
            aksakals.
            <br>
            After the trees are planted, everyone gathers for the celebration. People have fun, congratulate each other
            on New Year's Eve, and wish each other peace, prosperity, richness, and happiness. Songs composed especially
            for this holiday — Nauryz Zhyr — are performed. Sports competitions are held: kures wrestling, racing —
            baiga. Often in the middle of the village, there are big swings for children and youth. There are also
            intellectual contests for solving poetic riddles and contests in short sayings.
