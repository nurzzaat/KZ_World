                The nature of Kazakhstan is extremely diverse and it was not what I expected from a country famous for
                its vast steppes that look so empty from above. Little did I know that Kazakhstan has mountains too as
                well as alpine meadows, glacial lakes, desert sand dunes and wetlands.
                <br><br>
                There is a large number of spectacular national parks in Kazakhstan. Most of them still receive very few
                visitors and tourism in the country is still in its infancy. However, if you are looking for nature,
                Kazakhstan is a very rewarding place to visit. All you need to know is when to go where. Because every
                season has its own charms you can travel in Kazakhstan any time of the year.

        <div class="scnd-inf">
            All over the world, ecotourism is becoming more and more popular near specially protected natural areas
            such as national parks and reserves. This is because untouched oases are preserved there, and even if
            people are allowed any kind of recreation activity, it is quite strictly regulated.
            <br><br>
            Of course, there are much more places than just these twenty, which we will note in this article. This
            list will only help those who are traveling for the first time across the country. That is why we would
            like to list only the brightest pearls of our natural treasures that are located throughout several
            regions, combining those that are not far from each other into one.

                            The forests and lakes of Burabay are an oasis in the middle of the surrounding steppes. Both
                            northern and southern species of animals such as deer, elk, roe deer, etc, can be found
                            here. In the forests, foxes, wolves and hares are often seen running about. And even if it’s
                            not as often, you definitely will see them at some point! Also there are granite rocks of
                            beautifully bizarre forms, as if they were carved by someone out of giant slabs to resemble
                            these shapes. Almost everyone knows about its legend and their names. It is not surprising
                            that this region has long been loved by both locals and foreign travelers, and a perfect new
                            road directly from Nur-Sultan (Astana) provides easy access to there. It's just a 2 hour
                            drive, a bit over 250 km, and you are there!

                            To get to the Tengiz-Korgaljyn lake system is more difficult, because the road
                            to there is much worse; but pink flamingos you can see there, makes the treacherous journey
                            worth it! You just need to find the right form of transportation, off roaders in particular.
                            Besides, you are also likely to meet with the steppe Saiga antelopes!

                            restore habitats and migration routes of Saiga. Also, the purpose of the reserve is to
                            protect the unique wetlands of Irgiz-Turgay lake system as one of the places of the wetland
                            birds’ highest concentration during seasonal migrations and fish spawning grounds. The lands
                            of the reserve are included in the list of the International Union for Nature protection, as
                            the wetlands is conserving the unique Water fowl and semi aquatic bird species. These far

                            the Ile Alatau National Park. There is a paved road, which almost reaches the shore of the
                            lake making it very visited place. Even though sometimes there will be a lack of silence
                            around to fully enjoy the view, do not take the lake off your list. Rare birds such as
                            Sickle Bills still live here as well, and Edelweiss flowers grow on the slopes of the
                            mountains.

                            forests, Alpine and subalpine meadows. The gorge stretches 44 kilometers deep into Asy
                            Plateau (2560 meters in height). A walk to the waterfalls is very popular among travelers.
                            The walking distance from the main road to the Medvezhiy Waterfall (also known as Bear
                            Waterfall) is about a kilometer, and somewhere on the way, on the opposite slope of the
                            gorge, you can get to see the Skalisti Waterfall. After walking further along the large
                            Turgen River to the end of the waterfalls, you can continue the rest of your journey on four
                            wheels. The asphalt road to Batan village ends when you reach the settlement, but the Asy
                            Plateau would be waiting right ahead! After a long serpentine route there is this most
                            wonderful view of the plateau. A spacious summer pasture ‘jailau’ with nomads’ yurt,
                            stretches out to the East towards the Bartogay Reservoir, for 40 km, and in some places
                            reaches up to 15 km in width. On your way to and from, you can see sheepherders’ yurts. And
                            you can even visit them for a cup of hot aromatic tea.

                            at a height of 1818, 2252 and 2850 meters above sea level. Kaindy Lake is located 12 km east
                            of Kolsay Lakes and stretches out for 400 meters in length. You can visit the two lower
                            Kolsay Lakes and Kaindy Lake in one weekend trip. Upper Kolsay (the third lake) is located
                            about 4 km further from the second one and 600 m higher, and it requires a lot longer walk
                            and better physique of the climber to accomplish this tedious trek. Kolsay is a great place
                            for hiking, horse riding and mountain biking. Kaindy Lake appeared about a hundred years ago
                            as a result of the collapse of a huge mass of rock that blocked the gorge by placing a
                            natural dam. Dry fir trunks rise above the water surface like men on guard. The lake is
                            surrounded by rocky slopes and steep cliffs on all sides, and you can only drive up to the
                            water from one side.

                            encompassing the Almaty Province. The canyon is composed of sedimentary rocks, which can be
                            dated back to about 12 million years! At sunset the walls of the canyon, made from large
                            deposits of clay become red and shimmer with remarkably beautiful hues. The so-called
                            “Castles Valley” is the most visited place by tourists. Charyn Canyon resembles The Grand
                            Canyon in Texas, Colorado, in North America. Although it is inferior in size, the beauty of
                            the “Castles Valley” is enchanting and unique. It will also be interesting to visit the
                            Temirlik Canyon, where a grove of relic ash is preserved, as well as Uzunbulak Canyon (also
                            known as Moon Canyon) and Kurtogay Canyon.

                            popular and accessible place for travelers. The relict pine forests are preserved here, and
                            mountain lakes formed in the crater-like depressions of granite rocks are delighting the
                            eye. Two lakes, Shaytankol and Basseyn, located close by Karkaraly have their own names and
                            legends. More than a dozen other mountain lakes are located in the protected western part of
                            the National Park and are as beautiful as the abovementioned lakes. The inaccessibility of
                            the mountainous area is a good habitat for wild animals here, such as moose, roe deer,
                            foxes, hares, etc. There are even Red Book argali!
